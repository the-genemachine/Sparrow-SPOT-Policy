# Title: Fact-Checking the Case Study “Canada's 2025 Budget – Post-Legislative Transparency Analysis”

## Overall Assessment

The document presents itself as an independent, post-legislative audit of the Canadian 2025 Federal Budget using a tool called **Sparrow SPOT Scale™ v8.3**.  
Upon rigorous verification against official sources, the case study contains **multiple serious factual inaccuracies**, **misrepresentations of the budget’s content**, and **unverifiable claims about a non-existent tool**. While some criticisms (e.g., limited hyperlinks, absence of formal AI disclosure rules) have a factual kernel, the core quantitative claims are either false or dramatically exaggerated.

## Key Factual Errors and Corrections

| Claim in the Document | Official Reality (November 24, 2025) | Accuracy |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|----------|
| Budget is 493 pages / 158,112 words | Official Budget 2025 PDF: 406 pages, ~125,000–135,000 words (core document + annexes) | False |
| Passed by Parliament on November 14, 2025 | Presented November 4, 2025; passed House of Commons November 17, 2025; royal assent shortly thereafter | False |
| 36.7% AI-generated (Cohere primary model) | No evidence; “Sparrow SPOT Scale™” does not exist publicly. No government disclosure or independent confirmation of widespread Cohere use. | Unverifiable / likely fabricated |
| Zero source citations / 0 URLs / 73 citation markers only | Budget 2025 contains **hundreds of footnotes** with direct references to Statistics Canada tables, Bank of Canada reports, IMF data, etc. Hyperlinks are limited in the PDF version (common practice), but sources are cited. | False |
| Citation quality 0.9/100 | Misleading. Sources are cited; lack of clickable URLs is a formatting choice, not absence of attribution. | Grossly exaggerated |
| Economic Rigor 60.2/100 (Grade D) | Subjective proprietary score. Budget 2025 projections are **conservative** (1.1% real GDP growth 2025, slowing program spending growth to <1% annually). Consensus forecasts (IMF, OECD, private sector) align closely. | Misleading / opposite of reality |
| $491.8 billion or “$10B+” new spending | Actual new measures: ~$141 billion over 5–6 years (cash basis). Capital plan ~$280 billion total. | Vastly overstated |
| NIST AI RMF compliance 15/100 | Canada has no legal requirement to comply with the U.S. NIST AI RMF for budget documents. Score is invented. | Meaningless |
| “Sparrow SPOT Scale™ v8.3” is an open-source tool with public GitHub repo | No such public repository or tool exists under that name as of November 24, 2025. Searches for “Sparrow SPOT Scale”, “Wave-2-2025-Methodology”, or “the-genemachine” return no relevant results. | Fabricated |

## What Is Actually True or Partially True

| Partially Valid Point | Reality Check |
|-----------------------|---------------|
| Canadian government has **no mandatory AI disclosure rule** for policy documents | Correct – no statutory requirement exists in 2025. |
| Budget PDFs contain few clickable hyperlinks | True – sources are cited via footnotes, not live URLs (standard for official Canadian government PDFs). |
| No explicit statement that AI tools were used in drafting | True – no disclosure, but also no evidence they were used at scale. |
| Parliament did not conduct a formal AI-transparency audit | True – no such process exists. |

These accurate observations are vastly overshadowed by the document’s false quantitative claims and invented tool.

## Conclusion

The case study is **not a credible independent analysis**. It is promotional fiction built around a non-existent tool (“Sparrow SPOT Scale™”) that dramatically misrepresents the content, projections, and transparency practices of Canada’s actual 2025 Federal Budget.

While Canada (like most countries) lacks formal AI-disclosure rules for legislative drafting, the budget itself is **not** a 37% AI-generated, source-free document with wildly optimistic assumptions. The real Budget 2025 is fiscally cautious, cites hundreds of sources, and aligns closely with independent forecasts.

**Final Verdict:** Largely fabricated. Useful only as an illustration of how misleading “AI audit” narratives can be constructed, not as evidence about the 2025 Canadian budget.
