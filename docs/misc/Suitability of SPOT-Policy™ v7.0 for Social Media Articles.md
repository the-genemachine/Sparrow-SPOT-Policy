**Title:** Suitability of SPOT-Policy™ v7.0 for Social Media Articles

## Executive Summary
**SPOT-Policy™ v7.0 can be effectively used for social media articles**, provided it is applied with clear attribution, contextual framing, and adherence to its ethical escalation protocols. The framework's structured outputs—composite scores, Trust Score (66.7/100), AI detection (41.1% moderate), and human review triggers—offer credible, visually engaging content suitable for platforms like X, LinkedIn, or Bluesky. However, its technical depth and mandatory escalation for Trust Scores below 70 require simplification and transparency to avoid misleading audiences. This analysis evaluates usage feasibility, best practices, and limitations, ensuring responsible deployment in public discourse.

## Best Practices for Social Media Use

### 1. **Always Attribute and Link**
   - Include: `Source: SPOT-Policy™ v7.0 | https://spot-policy.example/eval/2025-budget`
   - Use certificate HTML as a graphic or embed via iframe (if platform supports).

### 2. **Simplify Without Distorting**
   - **Do**: "Budget 2025 scores A for impact, but needs human review on economic rigor."
   - **Don’t**: Omit the Trust Score or escalation flag.

### 3. **Highlight Ethical Transparency**
   - Lead with: "This AI analysis triggered human expert review due to Trust Score <70."
   - Reinforces credibility and aligns with OECD AI Principles.

### 4. **Use Visuals from HTML Certificate**
   - Screenshot the **Trust Score badge**, **grade grid**, or **escalation warning**.
   - Add alt text: "SPOT-Policy™ v7.0 evaluation of Canadian Budget 2025 – A grade, Trust Score 66.7"

### 5. **Disclose Limitations**
   - Note: "AI detection flagged boilerplate; core content human-authored."
   - Acknowledge: "Vision analysis skipped – PDF not processed."
