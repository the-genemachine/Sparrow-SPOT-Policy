SPARROW SPOT SCALE™ v8.3 - TRANSPARENCY FEATURES STATUS
================================================================================
Test Date: November 24, 2025
Test Document: 2025-Budget.pdf (493 pages)
Command: --deep-analysis --citation-check --enhanced-provenance --nist-compliance --lineage-chart html

================================================================================
✅ WORKING FEATURES (3/4)
================================================================================

1. ✅ ENHANCED PROVENANCE TRACKING
   File: 2025-Budget-v83-Working_provenance.json (365 bytes)
   Status: WORKING
   Output: JSON file with file metadata, hash, timestamps
   
2. ✅ NIST AI RMF COMPLIANCE
   File: 2025-Budget-v83-Working_nist_compliance.txt (3.0K)
   Status: WORKING  
   Output: Compliance score 15/100 across 4 pillars (GOVERN, MAP, MEASURE, MANAGE)
   Note: Score reflects basic analysis without full ethical framework integration
   
3. ✅ DATA LINEAGE VISUALIZATION
   File: 2025-Budget-v83-Working_lineage_flowchart.html (6.8K)
   Status: WORKING
   Output: Interactive HTML flowchart showing 11 pipeline stages with status indicators

⚠️  KNOWN ISSUES (1/4)
================================================================================

4. ⚠️  CITATION QUALITY SCORING
   File: (not generated)
   Status: FAILING
   Error: "expected string or bytes-like object, got 'dict'"
   
   Root Cause: Text extraction returns string correctly (1,043,624 chars), but 
   somewhere in the citation scorer's regex processing, a dict is being passed 
   where a string is expected.
   
   Workaround: Feature can be disabled by omitting --citation-check flag.
   All other features work independently.
   
   Next Steps: Debug citation_quality_scorer.py regex pattern iteration to
   identify where dict is being introduced.

================================================================================
OVERALL ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

✅ 75% of transparency features functional (3 out of 4)
✅ All critical features working (provenance, compliance, lineage)
✅ Deep analysis integration successful (36.7% AI, Cohere model detected)
✅ Certificate generation working with correct data
⚠️  Citation scoring requires additional debugging

RECOMMENDATION: v8.3 is production-ready for provenance tracking, compliance 
reporting, and workflow visualization. Citation scoring should be fixed in v8.3.1.
