## Appendix: Sample ROI Calculation

### PBO Scenario (Parliamentary Budget Officer)

**Current State:**
- 50 policy documents/year analyzed
- 80 hours/document × $75/hour analyst cost = $300K labor
- 2 FTE analysts × $100K salary = $200K
- **Total cost: $500K/year**

**With Sparrow:**
- 50 documents × 5 min analysis = 4.2 hours
- 50 documents × 1 hour review = 50 hours
- Total: 55 hours/year × $75/hour = $4,125
- **Total cost: $4,125/year**

**Savings: $495,875/year**

**Investment (Year 1):**
- Custom modules: $50,000
- Integration: $25,000
- Training: $15,000
- **Total: $90,000**

**Year 1 Net Benefit: $495,875 - $90,000 = $405,875**
**ROI: 450%**
**Payback Period: 1.1 months**

**5-Year Net Benefit: $495,875 × 5 - $90,000 = $2,379,375**
**5-Year ROI: 2,643%**

This demonstrates exceptional financial returns from implementing Sparrow SPOT Scale™ v8.3.
