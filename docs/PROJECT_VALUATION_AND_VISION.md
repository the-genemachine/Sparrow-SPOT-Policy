## 🎯 What The Application Does

### Core Functionality

Sparrow SPOT Scale™ is a **multi-dimensional document analysis platform** that:

1. **Detects AI-Generated Content** - Uses 8 different detection methods (GPTZero, Copyleaks, Turnitin simulation, Ollama, Gemini, Claude, Mistral, Cohere fingerprinting) to identify AI involvement in documents with consensus-based scoring.

2. **Grades Policy & Legislative Documents** - Evaluates documents across 5 criteria:
   - **Fiscal Transparency (FT)** - Budget clarity and financial disclosure
   - **Stakeholder Balance (SB)** - Representation of affected parties
   - **Economic Rigor (ER)** - Quality of economic analysis
   - **Public Accessibility (PA)** - Readability and citizen access
   - **Policy Consequentiality (PC)** - Impact assessment quality

3. **Audits for Bias & Fairness** - Real-time fairness auditing with demographic parity checks, escalation protocols, and NIST AI RMF compliance mapping.

4. **Generates Professional Outputs** - Produces:
   - HTML certificates with trust scores
   - Plain-language narratives for public consumption
   - Government formal disclosure statements
   - Social media-ready summaries
   - Data lineage flowcharts
   - JSON reports for system integration

5. **Analyzes Large Documents** - Enhanced Q&A system for documents exceeding LLM context windows:
   - Token counting with 3 estimation methods (quick/tiktoken/precise)
   - Intelligent chunking (section-based, sliding window, semantic)
   - Multi-chunk query routing (keyword/semantic/comprehensive/quick)
   - Answer synthesis with source attribution
   - Supports documents up to 1M+ characters (tested on Bill C-15)

6. **Handles Specialized Documents** - Domain-specific baselines for:
   - Legislation (bilingual EN/FR support)
   - Budget documents
   - Legal judgments
   - Policy briefs

## 🔮 The Opportunity

Sparrow SPOT Scale™ sits at the intersection of three massive trends:

1. **AI Proliferation** - Every organization is adopting AI, creating transparency needs
2. **Regulatory Acceleration** - EU AI Act, US Executive Orders mandate disclosure
3. **Trust Erosion** - Public demand for content authenticity is unprecedented

The platform is **technically sophisticated** (28K+ LOC, 8 detection methods, NIST compliance), **market-ready** (production outputs, professional certificates), and **strategically positioned** (GovTech focus, regulatory alignment).

**This is a rare opportunity to lead the AI transparency category before it becomes crowded.**
